# Description
**Recipe Search** is a siimpe and easy to use website that helps users search for new recipes by ingredients. Search any ingredient in the search bar, and a list of dishes that contains the entered ingredients will show up. Then, click on any dish to see more information, such as its picture, full list of ingredients, cook time, and a link to the full recipe instructions. You can also search with multiple ingredients!

# My Solution
For this website, I utilized HTML and CSS to format and design my website. Additionally, I utilized Javscript to make the website interactive by fetching data from Spoonacular API. When the user enters the ingredients in the search bar, the website makes a first API call to retrieve a list of dishes that contains the entered ingredient. When the user clicks on a dish, the website makes a second API call to gather more information about the dish and displays them. I used GitHub Pages to deploy and display my work.
